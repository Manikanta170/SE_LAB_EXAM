Minikube / Kubernetes — Lab Command Sequence
 A clear, ordered checklist you can run in the lab. Run commands in the same order. Use an Administrator/Root terminal
 on Windows (or sudo on Linux).
 Prerequisites (before starting)
 Ensure Docker Desktop (or a VM driver) and kubectl are installed. Run Docker Desktop and enable WSL2 if
 using Windows WSL2.
 If using Windows and you prefer Docker driver: enable Docker Desktop. If you plan to use Hyper-V, enable Hyper-V and
 the Hyper-V PowerShell module.
 1) Start Minikube
 Start a local Kubernetes single-node cluster using Docker as driver (recommended on Windows).
 Command(s):
 minikube start --driver=docker
 2) Check Minikube status
 Verify minikube and cluster components are running.
 Command(s):
 minikube status kubectl get nodes
 3) (Optional) Docker login
 Login to Docker Hub if you will pull private images (web-based login may open a browser).
 Command(s):
 docker login
 4) Create a Deployment (nginx example)
 Deploy nginx as an example app into Kubernetes (creates a Deployment and a Pod).
 Command(s):
 kubectl create deployment myngnix --image=nginx
 5) Check Pods and Deployment
 Confirm the pod is created and running.
 Command(s):
 kubectl get deployments kubectl get pods -o wide
 6) Scale the Deployment (add replicas)
 Increase number of replicas (simulate more instances for load).
 Command(s):
 kubectl scale deployment myngnix --replicas=4 kubectl get pods
 7) Describe a Pod for details
 View detailed information about one specific pod (replace POD_NAME with one from kubectl get pods).
 Command(s):
 kubectl describe pod
 8) View Pod logs
See container logs inside a pod - useful for debugging.
 Command(s):
 kubectl logs # For previous logs after restart: kubectl logs --previous
 9) Expose the Deployment as a NodePort service
 Expose the app to be reachable from host via a NodePort.
 Command(s):
 kubectl expose deployment myngnix --type=NodePort --port=80 --target-port=80 --name=myngnix
 kubectl get svc myngnix -o wide
 10) Find the NodePort
 Identify the port assigned on the node (the external port you can access).
 Command(s):
 kubectl get service myngnix # Look at PORT(S) column e.g. 80:31147/TCP
 11) Port-forward (recommended on Windows for localhost access)
 Port-forward service to local machine for stable localhost access.
 Command(s):
 kubectl port-forward service/myngnix 30088:80 # Keep this terminal open while testing # Access:
 http://127.0.0.1:30088
 12) Open the app in browser
 Open the forwarded URL (or NodePort) in your browser to confirm the app is reachable.
 Command(s):
 Open http://127.0.0.1:30088 or http://: in your browser
 13) Open Minikube Dashboard (visual monitoring)
 Launch the Kubernetes dashboard to visually inspect deployments, pods, and services.
 Command(s):
 minikube dashboard # This opens a browser with the dashboard URL; you can also run minikube
 dashboard --url to get the URL
 14) Enable metrics-server (optional, for resource usage and dashboard features)
 Install metrics-server addon to view CPU/memory usage and enable more dashboard features.
 Command(s):
 minikube addons enable metrics-server
 15) Simulate failure & observe self-healing
 Delete a pod manually to see Deployment recreate it (self-healing).
 Command(s):
 kubectl delete pod kubectl get pods
 16) Scale down or update image (rolling update)
 Update the deployment image (rolling update) or reduce replicas.
 Command(s):
kubectl set image deployment/myngnix myngnix=nginx:1.23.1 kubectl rollout status
 deployment/myngnix # OR kubectl scale deployment myngnix --replicas=2
 17) Rollout history and rollback (if needed)
 Check rollout history and rollback to previous revision if update caused issues.
 Command(s):
 kubectl rollout history deployment/myngnix kubectl rollout undo deployment/myngnix
 18) Clean up: delete service and deployment when done
 Remove the service and deployment to avoid leftover resources in the cluster.
 Command(s):
 kubectl delete service myngnix kubectl delete deployment myngnix kubectl get pods --all-namespaces
 19) Stop Minikube
 Halt the Minikube cluster; this powers off the node and frees local resources.
 Command(s):
 minikube stop
 20) Delete Minikube cluster (if you want to remove it completely)
 Remove all minikube VM/container artifacts — use when you no longer need the cluster.
 Command(s):
 minikube delete
